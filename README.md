# Introduction
The following programs were written to explore Machine Learning using Analytics Zoo and PySpark (Apache Spark with Python). The model training scripts are benchmarks, with results being used for the purposes of my final year research project at The University of Auckland. See each folder and script for details. Analytics Zoo provides High-Level API for BigDL applications. It integrates with popular machine learning libraries and frameworks like TensorFlow. It largely supports Intel processor architectures only. This was compared with (DL4J)[https://github.com/UtsavTrivedi16/Machine-Learning-Benchmarks-for-Distributed-Systems]

# OS and Tools
1) Ubuntu 18.04
2) PyCharm

# Results
Analytics Zoo is faster for training than DL4J but lacks compatibility with ARM architectures for further comparison.
